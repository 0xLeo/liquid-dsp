# iirdes (infinite impulse response filter design)
#

Liquid implements infinite impulse respone (IIR) filter design for the three major classes of filters (Butterworth, Chebyshev, and elliptic) as follows:

1. Use butterf(), cheby1f(), cheby2f(), ellipf() to design a low-pass analog prototype in terms of complex zeros, poles, and gain.

    butter_azpkf()
    cheby1_azpkf()
    cheby2_azpkf()
    ellip_azpkf()

2. Convert the low-pass analog prototype to its digital equivalent (also in terms of zeros, poles, and gain) using the bilinear z-transform
    - [LP]  : low-pass filter   : s = m * (1+z^-1) / (1-z^-1)
    - [HP]  : high-pass filter  : s = m * (1-z^-1) / (1+z^-1)
    - [BP]  : band-pass filter  : s = m * (1-c0z^-1+z^-2) / (1-z^-2)
    - [BS]  : band-stop filter  : s = m * (1-z^2) / (1-c0z^-1+z^-2)

    zpk_a2df()

3. Transform the digital z/p/k form of the filter to one of the three forms:
    - [tf]  : typical transfer function for digital iir filters of the form B(z)/A(z)
    - [sos] : second-order sections form : prod( Bk(z)/Ak(z) )
    - [ap]  : dual all-pass filter form: A0(z) + A1(z)
              NOTE: A0(z) and A1(z) should be able to take either the [tf] or [sos] form

    dzpk_to_tf()
    dzpk_to_sosf()
    dzpk_to_apf()

4. Create the filter object (e.g. iirfilt, iirqmfb) from the resulting structure

    iirfilt_crcf_create()
    iirfilt_crcf_create_sosf()
    iirfilt_crcf_create_apf()
