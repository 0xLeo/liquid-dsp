Major improvements since 1.0.0
  * build
    - simplifying build environment by explicitly defining object
      dependencies (no longer auto-generated; much faster now)
  * filter
    - firdes: adding Nyquist prototyping design method
    - interp: porting to efficient polyphase filterbank implementation,
      adding prototype create() method
  * framing
    - adding ofdmflexframe family of objects capable of defining which
      subcarriers are nulls/pilots/data, and easily loading data into
      frames. Very similar to 'flexframe' in usage.
  * matrix
    - adding Cholesky factorization A = R^T * R (for positive definite
      matrices)
    - adding conjugate gradient solver (for positive definite matrices)
  * modem
    - adding simple on/off keying (OOK) type
    - adding 256-APSK type (6,18,32,36,46,54,64)
    - adding 'square' (cross) 32-, 128-QAM types
    - improved speed of most schemes' modulate/demodulate
      implementations
  * multicarrier
    - ofdmframe: improving synchronization and reliability in
      interference environments, enabling squelch, improving
      equalization
  * optim
    - simplified interface to gradient search
