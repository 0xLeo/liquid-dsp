==========
Software-Defined Radio Digital Signal Processing Library

liquid-dsp is a free and open-source digital signal processing (DSP)
library designed specifically for software-defined radios on embedded
platforms. The aim is to provide a lightweight DSP library that does not
rely on a myriad of external dependencies or proprietary and otherwise
cumbersome frameworks. All signal processing elements are designed to be
flexible, scalable, and dynamic, including filters, filter design,
oscillators, modems, synchronizers, and complex mathematical operations.

For more information, please refer to the full documentation directory
`doc/` or download the pre-compiled `.pdf` documentation file from
<http://ganymede.ece.vt.edu/downloads/liquid.pdf> (4.4 MB).

Installation and Dependencies
-----------------------------

liquid-dsp only relies on `libc` and `libm` (standard C and math)
libraries to run; however liquid will take advantage of other packages
(such as [FFTW][]) if they are available.

### Getting the source code

There are two primary ways of obtaining the source code:

1. Download the tarball from
   <http://ganymede.ece.vt.edu/downloads/liquid-dsp-1.2.0.tar.gz> (2.6 MB),
   validate the checksum, and unpack 

        $ wget http://ganymede.ece.vt.edu/downloads/liquid-dsp-1.2.0.tar.gz
        $ wget http://ganymede.ece.vt.edu/downloads/liquid-dsp.md5
        $ md5sum --check liquid-dsp.md5
        $ tar -xf liquid-dsp-1.2.0.tar.gz

2. or clone the entire [repository][liquid-github]
        
        $ git clone git://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp.git

### Installation

Once you have obtained a copy of the source code, you can now build the
DSP library (NOTE: if you chose to clone the repository, you will need
to also run the additional `./reconf` bootstrapping script before
configuring):

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

If you are installing on Linux for the first time, you will also need
to rebind your dynamic libraries with `sudo ldconfig` to make the
shared object available.

If you decide that you want to remove the installed DSP library, simply
run

    $ sudo make uninstall

### Run all test scripts

Source code validation is a critical step in any software library,
particulary for verifying the portability of code to different
processors and platforms. Packaged with liquid-dsp are a number of
automatic test scripts to validate the correctness of the source code.
The test scripts are located under each module's `tests/` directory and
take the form of a C source file. liquid includes a framework for
compiling, linking, and running the tests, and can be invoked with the
make target `check`, viz.

    $ make check

### Examples

Nearly all signal processing elements have a corresponding example in
the `examples/` directory.  Most example scripts generate an output
`.m` file for plotting with [GNU octave][octave]. All examples are
built as stand-alone programs and can be compiled with the make target
`examples`:

    $ make examples

Sometimes, however, it is useful to build one example individually.
This can be accomplished by directly targeting its binary
(e.g. `make examples/modem_example`). The example then can be run at the
command line, viz. `./examples/modem_example`.

### Benchmarking tool

Packaged with liquid are benchmarks to determine the speed each signal
processing element can run on your machine. Initially the tool provides
an estimate of the processor's clock frequency and will then estimate
the number of trials so that each benchmark will take between 50 and
500 ms to run. You can build and run the benchmark program with the
following command:

    $ make bench

### Documentation

No serious software library would be complete without proper
documentation. There are basically two ways to get it: the easy way and
the hard way.

1. The easy way: download the pre-compiled documentation from
   <http://ganymede.ece.vt.edu/downloads/liquid.pdf> (4.4 MB).

2. The hard way: build from scratch.
   Because all of the figures within the documentation are generated
   with liquid itself, the documentation must be built from scratch and
   requires the following free programs and packages:

      - [pdflatex][ctan]    LaTeX compiler
      - [bibtex][ctan]      LaTeX bibliography generator
      - [pgf][] (v2.0)      LaTeX figures
      - epstopdf            convert .eps to .pdf (necessary for figures)
      - [gnuplot][]         plotting program
      - [pygments][]        pretty syntax hilighting program

  Once these dependencies are installed, you may build the documentation
  with the following command:

        $ make doc
