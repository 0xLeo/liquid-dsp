\section{Tutorial: Forward Error Correction}
\label{tutorial:fec}

This tutorial will demonstrate computation at the byte level by
introducing the forward error-correction (FEC) coding module.
Please note that \liquid\ only provides some very basic FEC
capabilities including some Hamming block codes and repeat codes.
While these codes are very fast and enough to get started,
they are not very efficient and add a lot of redunancy without providing
a strong level of correcting capabilities.
\liquid\ will use the convolutional and Reed-Solomon codes described in
{\em libfec} \cite{libfec:web} if installed on your machine.
%While not a requirement...
% maybe in the future these can be imported into liquid-dsp...
