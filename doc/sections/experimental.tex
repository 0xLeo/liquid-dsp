\section{experimental}
\label{module:experimental}

The experimental module is a placeholder for modules which haven't yet
been approved for release, but might eventually be incorporated into the
library.
By default the {\tt experimental} module is disabled and none of its
modules are compiled or installed.
It is enabled using the {\tt configure} flag {\tt --enable-experimental}
and includes the internal header file
{\tt include/liquid.experimental.h}.
