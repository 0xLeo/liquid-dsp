\subsection{Why C?}
A commonly asked question is ``why C and not C++?''
The answer is simple: {\em portability}.
Our aim is to provide a lightweight DSP library for software-defined radio
that does not rely on a miriad of dependencies.
While C++ is a fine language for many purposes (and theoretically runs just as
fast as C), it is not as portable to embedded platforms as C.
Furthermore, the majority of functions simply perform complex operations on a
data sequence and do not require a high-level object-oriented programming
interface.
This we will leave to framework developers and interface builders.

\subsection{Building/Linking with C++}
Here is an example:
