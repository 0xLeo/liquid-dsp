\section{Introduction}
Key points
\begin{itemize}
\item open-source software-defined radio DSP algorithms
\item minimal dependence on external libraries
\item portable to embedded platforms
\item flexible configuration
\item targets cognitive radios and enabling technologies through
      flexible algorithmic development
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item automatic test scripts for validation and accuracy
\item benchmark tool for estimating computational speed on your machine
\end{itemize}


\section{Quick Start Guide}
To build:
\begin{verbatim}
cd /path/to/liquid/
./reconf
./configure
make
sudo make install
\end{verbatim}
You may also want to build and run the optional validation program via
\begin{verbatim}
make check
\end{verbatim}
and the benchmarking tool,
\begin{verbatim}
make bench
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Why C?}
A commonly asked question is ``why C and not C++?''
The answer is simple: {\em portability}.
Our aim is to provide a lightweight DSP library for software-defined radio
that does not rely on a myriad of dependencies.
While C++ is a fine language for many purposes (and theoretically runs just as
fast as C), it is not as portable to embedded platforms as C.
Furthermore, the majority of functions simply perform complex operations on a
data sequence and do not require a high-level object-oriented programming
interface.
This we will leave to framework developers and interface builders.

\subsection{Building/Linking with C++}
Here is an example:
\input{listings/nco.c++.tex}

\section{History}
{\em liquid} was created by J. Gaeddert out of necessity to perform complex
digital signal processing algorithms on embedded devices
without relying on dealing
with proprietary and otherwise cumbersome frameworks.
This was a critical step in his PhD thesis to adapt DSP algorithms in
cognitive dynamic-spectrum radios to optimally manage finite radio resources.
Was he successful?
Put it this way: at the time this document was written he still has not
graduated.\footnote{Come back in a year and ask again... {\em sigh}}
